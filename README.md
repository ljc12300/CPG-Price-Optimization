This memo reviews our key findings and recommendations in relation to Tropicana 64oz sold at Nickâ€™s, a 15 store midwest regional grocery retailer. 

Fluctuations in orange juice sales make it challenging to predict and improve category profitability. 

Retail price is inconsistent across each store and frequent promotions have been introduced- proving the dynamic nature of pricing in this category. 

Our team reviewed weekly sales volume, retail price, and promotions for the item during a two-year period. 

Our analysis using a semi-log pricing model revealed considerable differences across stores, inconsistent price sensitivity, and a seasonality effect on sales, resulting in a $2.99 SRP recommendation for Tropicana 64oz.
